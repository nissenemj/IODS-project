# Toinen harjoitus

__DATA tuonti__

```{R}
data <- read.csv("learing_2019.csv")

#Summary
summary(data)

#Access ggplot and GGally
library(ggplot2)

library(GGally)


#Creating graphics
p1 <- ggplot(data, aes(x = Attitude, y = Points, col = gender))

#and fitting linear model
p2 <- p1 + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
p2
```

In these graphs we can see that gender plays a role. Biggest difference between genders seems to be on variable attitude, where females have a clearly lower mean. The distributions of the attitude and surf variables differ between males and females.

```{R}
#Correlations

p <- ggpairs(data, mapping = aes(col = gender, alpha = 0.3), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
p
     
## Regression model with multible explanatory variables
my_model <- lm(Points ~ Attitude + Stra + Surf, data = data)

# Summary of the model
summary(my_model)

```


Only attitude seems to be siqnificant in this fitted model. The multiple R squared of the model is in this case simply the square of the regression between Attitude and Points. Since it is around 0,2, approximately 20% of the variation of points can be explained by the variation of Attitude.

```{R}
# drawing diagnostic plots using the plot() function. Residuals vs Fitted values, Normal QQ-plot and Residuals vs Leverage.

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(my_model, which = c(1,2,5))

```
The assumptions of the model are that the error terms are approximately normally distributed with mean 0 and identical variation, uncorrelated and independent of the variable of interest. Specifically, the size of the error should not depend on the value of the explanatory or interesting variables.

From these pictures it seems that the model assumptions are approximately correct, with the small exception of small and large values of Points corresponding to some larger deviation from the estimated mean. Also, a couple of observations seem to have somewhat large leverages, but overall the assumptions of the model seem to hold quite well. Questionable is the ends of the spectrum, and additional analysis is needed.
